# Raft

This project implements the Raft consensus algorithm, a distributed protocol designed to maintain consistency and fault tolerance across a cluster of servers.

## Key Features

- **Leader Election**: Ensures one node acts as the leader to coordinate cluster operations.
- **Log Replication**: Guarantees consistent data replication across all nodes.
- **Fault Tolerance**: Handles node crashes and leader failures without compromising system reliability.

## What I Learned

- **Distributed Systems**: Developed expertise in consensus algorithms, replication, and fault tolerance mechanisms.
- **Concurrency**: Managed state transitions and synchronized actions across multiple nodes.
- **Algorithm Design**: Built robust remote procedure calls (RPCs) for core Raft functionalities.
